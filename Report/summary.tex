This thesis reports a variety of linear matrix methods for solving Sylvester Matrix that results from two-dimensional Heat Equation, and demonstrate the advantage of the structure of the problem. Such these linear matrix methods have a significant role in solving this matrix system. Moreover, these methods figure out the best performance and accurate results by observing the algorithm’s behavior.
