Second, I would also like to express the enormous gratitude and appreciation go to my parents and my brother Adel for their continued support and encouragement for me throughout my studies. Also, I offer my gratitude to my son Rakan for his constant support. 

Also, I would like to offer my gratitude and sincere appreciation to my supervisor Dr. Thomas Ranner for his valuable guidance and continuous support throughout this project.

Finally, I would like to conclude with my heartfelt thanks to my country, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which gave me this opportunity and offered me the sponsorship to continue my higher education.
